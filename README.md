# XPyriments: Automating your experimentation with PyCaret

**DISCLAIMER**: This notebook does not intend to achieve a model with great results.

**DISCLAIMER 2**: This was prepared using PyCaret 2.3.6, before that the OOP version was released.

The idea is to show how to automate experimentation and analysis using this great AutoML package, which compiles together awesome open source resources from multiple authors.

The package itself already automates a lot and it's great! We are just bringing experimentation into a more "*productionized*" layout.

We will go through a churn example from a dataset found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
